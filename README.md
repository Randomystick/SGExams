# SGExams
Written for managing the r/SGExams subreddit, using Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW). Languages: Python || Date created: Apr 2019

## Python Libraries
- Ensure you have the relevant libraries installed in your computer. PRAW is a must, other libraries are program specific.
- They can be installed by going into command prompt and typing "pip install _____"

## SGExams_Login
- This is the config file used to authenticate with Reddit's API where you provide your Reddit account details. The file in this repo is a dummy (I removed my own login details, obviously) so remember to supply your own credentials. Some scripts may require a mod account to execute.
