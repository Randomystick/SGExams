# WELCOME TO R/SGEXAMS PRIVATE MESSAGE #
    type: submission

    message: |
        Thank you for your submission to SGExams, /u/{{author}}! (⌒∇⌒) While you wait for your post to fill, here are some things you can do in the meantime:



         • **Check out the pinned megathread at the top of r/SGExams!**

            ➥ These are excellent for general comments where a detailed reply isn't needed, and serves as a common place for relevant parties to mingle.



         • **Search r/SGExams for past threads on the matter!**

            ➥ We've been around for quite a while now, so your question might already have been answered previously.



         • **Browse the rest of r/SGExams to help out your fellow peers/juniors!**

            ➥ SGExams wouldn't be what it is today without your continued support and our pay-it-forward culture, and we hope you'll stick around to answer questions on other threads!


        *Have trouble getting your post onto r/SGExams? Read our troubleshooting guide [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/bp7pe3/meta_posts_not_getting_through_read_me_sgexams/).*


        Once again, we wish to extend a warm welcome to you, whether you're a new user posting for the very first time or a regular checking in with the community ⊂(・ヮ・⊂). 


        We hope you'll continue being a part of our shared r/SGExams story, and wish you a good time! \\(\^■\^)/
